Introduction
Generative Adversarial Networks have gained significant popularity in the domain of image generation tasks. This project focuses specifically on generating anime faces, a challenging and visually appealing task. By employing GANs, the model learns to generate new anime face images that exhibit realistic features resembling those found in actual anime characters.

Requirements
Python 3.x
PyTorch
Torchvision
Wandb
Imageio
tqdm
Matplotlib
Getting Started
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/anime-face-generation.git
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure that you have access to a GPU if available, as training GANs can be computationally intensive.
Usage
Set up your environment by running the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
Ensure that the dataset of anime faces is properly prepared. You can use publicly available datasets or curate your own dataset.
Adjust hyperparameters and configurations as needed in the script.
Run the script to train the GAN model.
Monitor the training progress using the provided tools such as Weights & Biases integration and progress visualization.
Once trained, the model can be used to generate new anime face images.
